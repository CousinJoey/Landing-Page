# Landing-Page
From scratch landing page project from TOP

This website will be built with the following tools:
HTML, CSS, and Flexbox

The following skills were used during creation of this project:

HTML; creation of classes, parenting/nesting elements
Commenting, Use of list and div elements, pratice
with editing HTML documents to achieve desired CSS changes

CSS; Calling upon div classes, as well as whole elements;
basic text changes/div changes such as: font, weight, background, etc. Practice with more "advanced" methods of editing content such as rounded borders


Flexbox; Using alignment tools such as: justify-content, align-items/content, etc. using parented/nested containers to achieve desired product

Skills needed to learn: Better pratice/tools to align content, I still struggle aligning things perfectly and it leads to me just slapping different code together trying to get it to work
